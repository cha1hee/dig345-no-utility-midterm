                all the time. This project exposes our subconsciousness making judgements on the character of a person just by an instagram post.
                We take the information given on social media at face value and believe that a person's entire life is based off of these instant
                snap shots of a life. How exposing is social media really? What can you really know from a person's feed? These are all questions 
                that this project hopes to evoke to visitors.
